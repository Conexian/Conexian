## Greetings,

I’m *Conexian*, an aspiring coder aged *15*, and currently on my journey to get a hold of **Python**. I am quite good at **Batch scripting** and **VBS** but like to try out different projects if time allows me.

The goal that I set for myself now is **learning Python** well enough to write something *productive* without getting stuck. Though currently there’s no active working on any projects, I have a great desire to make **multi-tools** and also develop **automation scripts** aiming to minimize the number of efforts required for completing the tasks.

If there are any questions or topics concerning the code ask on Discord: **Silveract**. (Reach out if you may want access to my private Repositories!)

Now that I got quite a few **repositories** under my belt, all of them are private by design, but I will probably uncloak them in case I find them worthy enough. I also depend on **AI** for *learning* but not all the time do I manage to code all with my hands.

Eager to resume my further development in *programming*.
